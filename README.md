# StudentFlex Diagram Using Eclipse OCL

This project contains a comprehensive class diagram for the StudentFlex system, created using Eclipse OCL (Object Constraint Language). The class diagram visually represents the structure and constraints of the StudentFlex system, which is designed to manage student-related activities and data efficiently.



## Features

- **Accurate Modeling:** The class diagram accurately models the StudentFlex system, including all relevant classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
- **OCL Constraints:** The use of Eclipse OCL ensures that the system’s constraints and rules are explicitly defined and enforced.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Extensive documentation provides a clear understanding of the system’s design and the rationale behind each component.




## Contents

- **Class Diagram:** The core UML class diagram illustrating the structure of the StudentFlex system.
- **OCL Constraints:** Files (invariants.txt) containing the invarants for the Class Diagram and the word doc contains the necessary screenshots.
- **Setup Guide:** Step-by-step instructions for setting up the Eclipse environment to work with the class diagram and OCL constraints.


## Prerequisites
- Eclipse IDE: Ensure you have the latest version of Eclipse IDE installed.
- Eclipse OCL Plugin: Install the Eclipse OCL plugin to handle OCL constraints.



## Usage

- ***Viewing the Diagram:*** Open the class diagram file in Eclipse to view the system’s structure.
- ***Editing Constraints:*** Use the Eclipse OCL editor to modify and validate the constraints.
- ***Generating Code:*** (Optional) Use the Eclipse modeling tools to generate code from the class diagram.
